ANSWER KEY - Page 30
1. The correct answer is E. According to the archeological evidence, paleo-anthropologists, experts who
study ancient human societies, believe that earliest hominids date back approximately four million years. The
evidence is limited, and new evidence could be discovered in the future, as well as new interpretations made
of the evidence.
2. The correct answer is B. The Sumerians of Mesopotamia were the world's first civilized peoples,
establishing an urban society with written records and monumental architectural and engineering projects in
the fourth millennium BCE. There were approximately twenty Sumerian city-states, often at war with one
another, thus politically and militarily similar to the Greek city-states three thousand years later.
3. The correct answer is A. Like many original writings, Sumerian writing was originally pictographic.
However, it eventually evolved into a number of characters that were cuneiform, or wedge-shaped. Marks
and symbols were pressed into soft clay that was later dried into hard clay tablets. Only a minority of
Sumerians were literate, and although the script probably originally was used for record keeping, in time it
expressed educational concepts and epic poetry, notably Gilgamesh.
4. The correct answer is B. The famous Code of Hammurabi was a system of harsh laws, but one which
afforded some justice for all social classes. It treated the lower classes more harshly than the ruling elite and
thus reflects the value system of ancient Babylonian society.
5. The correct answer is E. Hammurabi's famous law code was carved upon what is known to
archeologists as a stela. The upper section of the stela shows Hammurabi standing in front of the sun god
Shamash, who has ordered Hammurabi to write down the laws. The lower section of the stela contains the
code itself.
6. The correct answer is A. The Hyksos, a Semitic people probably from Asia Minor, infiltrated Egypt in
the seventeenth century BCE, an era that coincided with the end of the Middle Kingdom. Whether the Hyksos
were the cause or the consequences of the decline of the Middle Kingdom is debated, but the Hyksos ruled
Egypt until the rise of Egypt's New Kingdom in the sixteenth century BCE.
7. The correct answer is C. Many biblical scholars, relying in part upon recent archeological evidence,
doubt that the early books of the Hebrew Bible reflect the true history of the Israelites. Written centuries after
the events described, the writings reflect what the ancient Israelites had come to believe about their origins.
8. The correct answer is D. The ancient Hebrews believed that their God ruled all peoples, that he was a
transcendent God that created nature but was outside of nature, and that he was a just God but also merciful
and loving to those who worshiped him and obeyed him.
9. The correct answer is A. Amenhotep IV (r. 1364–1347) took the name Akhenaten after introducing the
worship of Aten, god of the sun disk, as his and Egypt's god. He closed the temples of the other gods,
particularly those of Amon-Re, and established a form of monotheism. However, it did not outlast his reign,
and under Tutankhamen (r. 1347–1338) the old gods returned.
10. The correct answer is D. Akhenaten and his wife, Nefertiti, and their daughters are portrayed in this
carved relief. The work shows the rays of Aten, god of the sun disk, shining down on the royal family.
Akhenaten's religious revolution carried over into art, and instead of the formal style of most Egyptian art,

11. The correct answer is C. At the height of the Assyrian empire in the eighth century, a king whose
power was absolute ruled the vast kingdom. The priests of Ashur were under royal control; there were no
independent governors or representative institutions under the control of Assyria's landed aristocracy.
12. The correct answer is C. Cyrus the Great established the great Persian Empire, but it was his son and
successor, Cambyses, who incorporated Egypt into the empire, taking the title of pharaoh in 525 BCE.
Cambyses' successor, Darius, invaded Greece but was forced to withdraw after his defeat at the Battle of
Marathon in 490.
13. The correct answer is B. The Persian Empire created by Cyrus the Great was the largest empire yet in
world history. Efficiently governed, the empire was divided into twenty or so provinces called satrapies that
proved to be an effective system for collecting taxes, administering justice, and maintaining military security.
The governors, or satraps, were Persian nobles, and the office was often hereditary.
14. The correct answer is B. About 1200 BCE, the so-called Sea Peoples destroyed the Hittite empire and
at the same time seriously weakened the Egyptian empire, although the latter survived. The resulting vacuum
allowed minor states to emerge in modern Syria and Palestine, including the kingdom of Israel.
15. The correct answer is E. Minoan civilization on the island of Crete dominated the Aegean and traded
throughout the eastern Mediterranean Sea from about 2000 to 1450 BCE. The palace at Knossus was the
royal center of the Minoan kings, but after the collapse of Minoan civilization, it totally disappeared from
human knowledge until discovered by the English archeologist Arthur Evans in 1900.
16. The correct answer is C. During the twelfth century, new waves of Greek-speaking people invaded
Greece, coinciding with the collapse of the Greek Mycenaean civilization. During the Dark Ages that
followed (c. 1100–750 BCE), many of the earlier Greeks fled east across the Aegean Sea to Asia Minor,
which became known as Ionia.
17. The correct answer is C. In the eighth century, after the end of the Dark Ages, the polis, or city-state,
emerged as the central institution in Greek civilization. The polis could vary in size and was a true
community of citizens, encompassing political (from polis), economic, social, and cultural activities of the
Greeks. There was considerable rivalry between the city-states, and warfare was endemic.
18. The correct answer is D. After the Dark Ages, local aristocrats dominated polis society and politics. A
widening gap between the rich and the poor as well as the rise of commercial and industrial groups saw the
emergence of tyrants in many city-states. Tyrants could be good or bad. What defined a tyrant was someone
who ignored the existing laws. In the city-states, the landed aristocracy benefited from the existing laws, thus
the tyrants represented the poorer groups and the new commercial wealth.
19. The correct answer is C. The sculpture dates from c. 600 BCE and is an example of Archaic Greek art.
The nude statue is a kouros sculpture, which were to be found in temples and meant to be portrayals of the
faithful worshippers of the gods. A female figure from the same era is known as a korai.
20. The correct answer is A. Sparta, located in the southern Peloponnesus, was an expansionist city-state.

ANSWER KEY - Page 32
After taking over the Loconians and the nearby Messinians and making them helots, or slaves, the outnumbered Spartans made the decision that for security reasons Sparta must create a military state society.
21. The correct answer is C. Greek culture of the Archaic Age (c. seventh century) is exemplified by the
lyric poetry of Sappho, whose verse focuses upon personal emotions and the power of love. Hesiod's Works
and Days is also a product of the Archaic Age, but, as a farmer, he distrusted the aristocrats and their values
of pride and war. Homer's works represent the earlier heroic era, and the symposium and Plato were of the
later fifth and fourth centuries.
22. The correct answer is E. In the aftermath of the Persian War (499–479 BCE), the Delian League was
formed to resist a possible Persian return. Athens transformed the League into its own empire, which led to
the Peloponnesian War when Sparta and others became fearful of Athenian imperialism. The Peloponnesian
War (431–404) resulted in Athens' defeat and the loss of its empire.
23. The correct answer is A. Thucydides, the historian of the Peloponnesian War, is considered to be the
greatest historian of the ancient world. Unlike Herodotus, who wrote of the earlier Persian War, Thucydides
did not see history as the product of divine forces or the gods but as the result of the actions of human beings.
24. The correct answer is B. Early Greek philosophy attempted to explain the universe on the basis of
unifying principles. Thales of Miletus claimed water was the unifying principle, and Pythagoras stated that
music and numbers formed the essence of the universe. The early philosophers did not deny the divine but
identified it with the underlying universal forces.
25. The correct answer is E. Socrates (469–399 BCE) believed that all real knowledge is within each
person and a critical examination of one's self could reveal it, thus his belief that the "unexamined life is not
worth living." Plato was a student of Socrates. Aristotle and Pythagoras were also philosophers, and Pericles
was an Athenian statesman and politician.
26. The correct answer is D. After conquering most of the Persian Empire and capturing the Persian
capitals of Susa and Persepolis, Alexander continued his campaign into the eastern regions of the Persian
Empire. When he reached the lands of India, he was initially victorious at the Battle of the Hydespes River in
326 BCE, and wished to go on and conquer the rest of India, but his troops rebelled, weary of so many years
of battles and campaigns.
27. The correct answer is E. Upon his death in 323 BCE, Alexander left only an infant son as his heir, and
his generals fought for control of his empire. Ptolemy gained possession of Egypt (and Alexander's corpse,
which was entombed in Alexandria) and established a dynasty which ended only with the death of Cleopatra
in 30 BCE. Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty outlasted the Antigonid in Macedonia, which fell to Rome in 148
BCE, and the Seleucid dynasty in the Near East, which fell in the 60s BCE, also to Rome.
28. The correct answer is A. In classical Greece, education was a private matter as evidenced by Socrates'
informal band of students and in Plato's Academy. In the Hellenistic era, Greek cities often took
responsibility for educational matters. The curriculum generally focused upon music, physical exercise, and
literature, particularly the Homeric epics.
29. The correct answer is A. Euclid (c. 300 BCE) established a school in Egypt's Alexandria, but he is most

famous for his book Elements, which was a systematic organization of the previously established
fundamental elements of geometry. It became the standard text of plane geometry and remained in use until
modern times.
30. The correct answer is C. The two sculptures are from the Hellenistic era. Many of the artists continued
to be Greek, but instead of the idealism of the classical period, artists now emphasized a more emotional and
realistic portrayal of humans and often used children, old women, and drunks as subjects.
31. The correct answer is C. The philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism addressed individual needs
for personal happiness and fulfillment rather than the communal values of the polis. In the cosmopolitan
cities of the Hellenistic civilization, with their mixtures of peoples and cultures, there was also a new
openness to ideas' universality, particularly among Stoics. Through it all, Athens remained a philosophical
center.
32. The correct answer is C. In the Hellenistic era, the vitality of the traditional Olympian religion declined
as the civic cults associated with the Olympian gods no longer satisfied the emotional needs of the Greeks.
The quest for emotional satisfaction made the Greeks receptive to the many eastern religious cults, including
the mystery religions with their secret initiation ceremonies and promises of individual salvation.
33. The correct answer is A. There were large Jewish communities outside of Judea, particularly in
Alexandria and other cities of Asia Minor and Syria. Although some cities gave them political rights through
the formation of political associations, the Jews were usually not fully integrated into Hellenistic culture
because of their monotheistic religion that prohibited worship of the cities' gods.
34. The correct answer is C. Rome was founded on the Tiber River, eighteen miles from the sea and from
the nearest river crossing. From this position, it had access to the sea but was safe from piracy. The city was
built on seven easily defendable hills south of the Tiber. Italy itself had fewer rugged mountains than Greece,
facilitating the political unification of the peninsula.
35. The correct answer is A. Although Roman control over much of Italy was gained on many battlefields,
it was diplomatic genius that ratified and made permanent those military victories. Unlike the Greeks, the
Romans were superb diplomats, not least in extending Roman citizenship with its rights and privileges to
non-Romans and allowing non-Roman cities considerable autonomy in domestic affairs.
36. The correct answer is D. Greeks had colonized much of southern Italy in the seventh and sixth
centuries BCE. As the influence of Rome spread into the south, conflict arose between Romans and Greeks.
Lacking standing armies, the Greeks hired mercenaries, notably Pyrrhus of Epirus in Greece, to defend them
against the Romans. Pyrrhus defeated two Roman armies, but each victory was so costly to Pyrrhus that he
withdrew back to Greece, thus the expression "Pyrrhic victory."
37. The correct answer is D. The first war between Rome and Carthage (known as the First Punic War)
occurred when Rome sent an army to Sicily to intervene in a conflict between two Sicilian cities. Carthage
claimed that Sicily was in its sphere of influence and thus Rome's dispatch of an army was cause for war. The
war lasted from 264 to 242, with Rome victorious at the end and Carthage required to pay an indemnity.
38. The correct answer is B. After the Second Punic War, all that remained of Carthage was the city-state

of Carthage; Rome had become the imperial power of the entire western Mediterranean. However, some
Romans, notably Cato, wanted more. At the conclusion of every speech Cato addressed to Rome's senate,
Cato argued "Carthage must be destroyed." The Third Punic War (149–146) was in essence Cato's war.
Carthage was destroyed and Africa became a Roman province.
39. The correct answer is B. In 107 BCE, Marius obtained from the Senate a military command to subdue a
North African uprising against Rome. Traditionally, the Roman army was made up of small farmers. Since
the number of small farmers had declined, Marius recruited an army from the rural and urban landless
workers. Marius promised his recruits land, and they swore an oath of allegiance to him rather than to the
Senate, thus weakening the governing institutions of the Republic.
40. The correct answer is E. Toward the end of the Republic, Roman writers produced a new poetry that
was less dependent upon epic themes and expressed more intimate and personal feelings about people, social
and political life, and love. The writer most closely associated with the new poetry was Catullus (c. 87–54
BCE), particularly in his passionate love for Clodia, a promiscuous married woman whom he called Lesbia.
41. The correct answer is A. The Praetorian Guard, which numbered about 9,000 elite troops, was
established by Augustus and was responsible for protecting the princeps, or the emperor. Recruited from
Italy, they were Roman citizens and served a 16-year enlistment. Because of their close access to the
emperor, they also at times played a role in getting rid of emperors and choosing new ones.
42. The correct answer is B. Augustus established a new system to govern the many provinces of the
Roman Empire. Some of the provinces, the most important, were directly under his rule and governed by
legates, while other provinces were the responsibility of the senate and governed by proconsuls and
proprietors. In practice, Augustus could overrule the senate's governors, thus giving the princeps effective
control over all the provinces.
43. The correct answer is E. Livy's History of Rome is the most famous Latin prose work of Rome's Golden
Age, although only 35 of the original 142 books have survived. For Livy, human character was the key to
history. Meditations was written in the second century CE by Marcus Aurelius, Satires was composed by
Horace, the Aeneid was Virgil's great epic poem, and Ovid wrote Metamorphoses.
44. The correct answer is A. Tiberius (r. 14–37 CE), Augustus' successor, initially tried to involve the
Senate in government, but as time went on, he and the other Julio-Claudians (Caligula, Claudius, and Nero)
relied upon the developing imperial bureaucracy rather than the senate. Increasingly, the Julio-Claudians
acted less like princeps, or "the first citizens of the state," and more like emperors.
45. The correct answer is C. Seneca (c. 4 BCE–65 CE) served as a teacher and later as a chief advisor to
the emperor Nero (r. 54–68). A stoic, Seneca wrote a series of letters on the basic themes of stoicism,
including living according to nature, to accept events dispassionately, and to love humanity. In 65, Seneca
was accused of plotting against Nero and was forced to commit suicide.
46. The correct answer is E. The classical age of Roman law was in the second and early third centuries
CE. Laws were codified and the basic legal principles established. The major legal figure was Ulpian (d.
228), who claimed that the law of nations was equivalent to natural law, including natural rights such as the
principle that all men are born equal and should be equal before the law. It was many centuries before these

CLEP Western Civilization I
ANSWER KEY - Page 35
principles were universally adopted.
47. The correct answer is C. Other than Jesus, the key figure of early Christianity was Paul of Tarsus. Paul,
a Jewish Roman citizen, taught that Jesus was the Son of God who had come to earth to atone for humanity's
sins through his death and resurrection. By believing in Jesus, all could look forward to individual salvation.
Paul preached the Christian message to both Jews and non-Jews. Although tradition has it that Paul died in
Rome, the first bishop of Rome, or first pope, was Peter.
48. The correct answer is B. Romans were generally tolerant of the many religions of the empire and
initially perceived Christianity as merely a Jewish sect. However, some came to believe that Christians
practiced ritual murder, and more claimed that since Christians refused to participate in public festivals
honoring other gods, they were traitors. Useful scapegoats, Christians were blamed by Nero for the great fire
that ravaged Rome, but generally Roman persecution of Christians was only sporadic and local.
49. The correct answer is D. In response to the numerous disasters of the third century, Diocletian (r. 284–
305) and Constantine (r. 306–337) created a new imperial structure. The army and the civil service were
enlarged at considerable financial cost. Wages and price controls were instituted, occupations were made
hereditary, and taxes increased. Although the empire was temporarily strengthened, it was only done so by
coercion and the loss of individual freedom.
50. The correct answer is E. As the empire declined in the third and fourth centuries, emperors such as
Diocletian and Constantine increased the autocratic and dictatorial nature of imperial rule. Constantine (r.
306–337), here pictured, was noted for the massive statues and busts that he used in an attempt to hold the
empire together.
51. The correct answer is B. The Western Roman Empire survived into the late fifth century in spite of
numerous disasters. In 410, the German barbarian Visigoths sacked the city of Rome, and in 455, another
German barbarian tribe, the Vandals, again sacked Rome. In 476, Odovacer, a German military leader,
deposed Romulus Augustulus, the last of the Western Roman emperors. The Western Roman Empire had
ceased to exist, but the Eastern Roman Empire survived another thousand years.
52. The correct answer is A. Arius was a priest from Alexandria who claimed that Jesus was human and
thus not truly God. The Council of Nicaea, called by Constantine in 325, condemned Arianism as a heresy,
stating that Jesus was of "the same substance" as God. However, Arianism continued to be a threat to
Orthodox Christianity for some considerable time, particularly among many German tribes and kingdoms
where Arian Christianity remained influential.
53. The correct answer is A. St. Benedict of Nursia (c. 480–c. 543) rejected the asceticism and extremism,
as frequently practiced by early Christian monks, in favor of the ideal of moderation when he established his
monastery. A monk had to take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, and Benedict's rules divided the
day into a series of activities, with the emphasis upon prayer and manual labor.
54. The correct answer is D. Many early Christians rejected entirely the pagan or non-Christian culture of
ancient Greece and Rome, claiming that the Bible contained all necessary knowledge. Others, however, such
as St. Augustine (354–430), argued that pagan culture could be used in the service of Christianity.
Neoplatonism was particularly influential in the third century CE and was used in attempts to connect the

invisible spiritual world with the visible material world using reason.
55. The correct answer is C. In 732, Charles Martel, the mayor of the Frankish kingdom of Austrasia and
the most powerful figure among the Franks, defeated the Muslim armies from Spain at the Battle of Tours,
near the city of Poitiers. The Battle of Tours is often considered to be a watershed event. If Charles had lost
the battle, the history of western civilization might have been considerably different. Islam retained a political
and military presence in Spain until 1492.
56. The correct answer is E. Justinian (r. 527–565) was the most important of all the Eastern Roman, or
Byzantine, emperors. He invaded Italy and destroyed the Gothic kingdom, but was unable to complete his
conquests. After a fire in Constantinople, the city was rebuilt, including the church of the Hagia Sophia, or
Holy Wisdom, one of the world's great buildings. However, Justinian's most important contribution was his
codification of the Roman law. Written in Latin, Corpus Iuris Civilis (The Body of Civil Law) was the basis
of imperial law until the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, and in time became the basis of the legal
system of all of continental Europe.
57. The correct answer is D. Among the finest examples of Byzantine mosaics are those to be found in the
Church of San Vitale at Ravenna in northern Italy. Pictured here is a mosaic of Justinian (r. 527–565). Across
the aisle from Justinian and his court is an equally fine mosaic of the empress Theodora.
58. The correct answer is A. For both the rich and the poor in the Carolingian world, the staple food was
bread, particularly among the peasants. The upper classes had a more varied diet, including pork and wild
game. It rarely included beef or mutton, because cows were used for dairy products and sheep produced wool.
Corn, or maize, did not arrive in Europe until after 1492.
59. The correct answer is B. Charlemagne's son and heir, Louis the Pious (r. 814–140) divided up the
Carolingian Empire at the time of his death. His three sons each received a portion, with Charles the Bald
gaining the west, Louis the German the east, and Lothair awarded a "Middle Kingdom." None were satisfied,
and they and their heirs struggled and warred over the disputed territories for many centuries.
60. The correct answer is D. The Vikings, from modern Scandinavia, were superb shipbuilders and sailors.
Long and narrow, the ships had a shallow draft that allowed them to be sailed up rivers. Banks of oars as well
as a single great sail propelled the boats. With these ships, the Vikings journeyed far out into the Atlantic and
to the western hemisphere and down the rivers of Russia to the Black Sea and beyond.
61. The correct answer is A. Feudalism was a relationship between lords and vassals. All lords and vassals
belonged to the ruling class, and represented a relatively small percentage of the total population. In
feudalism, the lord distributed land to the vassal and the vassal provided military service or support to his
lord. Lords in turn supported their vassals when necessary. Disputes between lords and vassals could lead to
war and often did. In the Middle Ages, serfs worked but did not fight.
62. The correct answer is B. The Vikings who invaded Anglo-Saxon England were the Danes, and the
northern part of England that they occupied became known as the Danelaw. In 879, the king of Wessex,
Alfred the Great (r. 871–879), defeated a Danish army, and in 866 he made peace with the Danes. His
successors reconquered the Danelaw area and by the reign of Edgar (r. 959–975), a unified Anglo-Saxon
monarchy was established.

63. The correct answer is C. In 661, Muawiya, the governor of Syria, became the caliph, or the temporal
leader of the Islamic community. He established a ruling dynasty known as the Umayyads, which moved the
capital of the Muslim empire from Medina in Arabia to Damascus in Syria. A hundred years later the
Abbasids would replace the Umayyads and move the capital further east to Baghdad in modern Iraq.
64. The correct answer is C. Between 1000 and 1300 the population of Europe doubled. The explanations
for this population explosion are twofold. The end of the Viking and other invasions of the Early Middle
Ages had ended, bringing greater security and stability. Additionally, agricultural production increased
dramatically due to an increase in the area of cultivated land and improved technology such as the carruca, a
heavy wheeled-plow with an iron plowshare, the horse collar, and iron horseshoes.
65. The correct answer is D. Throughout history, those with power maintained and increased their power
through marriage alliances arranged between families, and that had little or nothing to do with feelings of
love or romance. The medieval aristocracy was no different. Aristocratic girls were married in their midteens, although males were generally married at a later age.
66. The correct answer is C. By the eleventh century, long-distance trade had returned to Europe,
accompanied by an urban revival that initially evolved in northern Italy and in Flanders in northern Europe.
Trade fairs proliferated, the most famous being the fairs organized by the counts of Champagne. Local trade
did not decline in Europe's rural world. Rather it increased, as it established closer ties to the developing
urban society.
67. The correct answer is A. The first European university appeared in Bologna, Italy. It coincided with the
rediscovery of Justinian's The Body of Civil Law. Bologna became the center for the study of Roman law,
attracting students from all over Europe, particularly because of the teaching of Irnerius (1088–1025). The
University of Paris was the first university in northern Europe. By the end of the Middle Ages there were 80
universities in Europe.
68. The correct answer is B. By the twelfth century, there was a renewed interest in the scientific and
philosophical writings of the classical world. Greek works, notably those of Aristotle, filtered into the West
through Islam, particularly through Islamic Spain. Muslim and Jewish scholars translated the Greek writings
from Arabic into Latin, making them accessible in the non-Greek-reading West.
69. The correct answer is A. The Song of Roland (Chanson de Roland) is the earliest and finest example of
the medieval heroic epic, or chanson de geste. Written not in Latin but in a French dialect that had evolved
from Latin and become the vernacular language, The Song of Roland appeared around 1100. The chief events
described in the chanson de geste are battles and political conflicts that appealed to the male society of the
Middle Ages.
70. The correct answer is E. One of the most famous dates in medieval history is 1066. In that year,
William, Duke of Normandy, defeated Harold at the Battle of Hastings and became England's king. In 1086,
William the Conqueror ordered a survey of his new kingdom and land ownership in England. The results
were compiled in the Doomsday Book. Magna Carta is associated with an almost equally famous date in
English history, the year 1215.

71. The correct answer is D. Barrel vaults and massive pillars and walls were characteristic of Romanesque
architecture of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries. The later Gothic churches used ribbed vaults and
pointed arches, allowing the churches to be built higher and giving the impression of upward movement.
Flying buttresses on the outside distributed the weight outward and downward, thus eliminating the heavy
walls of the Romanesque architecture. The first Gothic church was the Abbey church of Saint-Denis outside
of Paris, constructed c. 1150.
72. The correct answer is D. Stained-glass windows are a feature of Gothic architecture. Although Gothic
churches were higher than the Romanesque, the flying buttresses on the exterior distributed the weight
outward and downward, thus eliminating the heavy walls of the Romanesque. Thinner and lighter walls
allowed the use of stained-glass windows, as illustrated here by the Chartres Cathedral in France.
73. The correct answer is B. When the Cepetians ascended to the French throne following the expiration of
the Carolingian dynasty in the late tenth century, they controlled only the lands around Paris known as the
Ile-de-France. Many of the vassals of the early Capetian rulers were in reality much more powerful than the
French kings. It was only in the early thirteenth century that the Capetians achieved significant control over
their vassals.
74. The correct answer is A. Pope Gregory VII (r. 1073–1085) was one of the most powerful of the
medieval popes. In 1075, he issued his papal dictates, which included the claim that popes had the right to
depose emperors, that the pope could cancel oaths of fealty, and that he could be judged by no one, king or
council. In 1077, Gregory deposed the German emperor, Henry IV, over lay investiture, or the selecting of
church officials. To regain his throne, Henry had to beg Gregory's forgiveness at Canossa in northern Italy, a
famous event in the Middle Ages that illustrated the power of the church over the state.
75. The correct answer is E. By the mid-eleventh century the Islamic world was largely unified and
dominated by the Seljuk Turks, a nomadic people from Central Asia who converted to Islam and served the
Abbasid caliphs as mercenary soldiers. In 1055, a Seljuk Turk captured the Abbasid capital of Baghdad,
ending the Abbasid empire, and took the title of sultan. The Fatimids ruled in Egypt and controlled much of
North Africa, while the Ottoman Turks emerged later, in the twelfth century.
76. The correct answer is C. The Fourth Crusade of 1204 was notorious among the many crusades. Instead
of reaching the Holy Land, the crusaders allied themselves with the Venetians and captured and sacked the
Byzantine Empire's capital of Constantinople. In the aftermath, the Venetians established the Latin Empire of
Constantinople. Although the Byzantines regained Constantinople in 1261, the restored empire was in
permanent decline and never again achieved the status of a great Mediterranean power.
77. The correct answer is A. The Black Death, mainly the bubonic plague, arrived in the West in 1347, and
within a short time had killed between 25% and 50% of the population. Many, believing that death was near,
lived only for the moment. Crime and other anti-social behavior increased and many turned away from the
institutional church. The death rate from the plague was much higher in crowded urban areas than in the more
isolated countryside.
78. The correct answer is A. The Black Death cut the European population almost in half, creating a labor
shortage and thus improving the bargaining position for peasants and other laborers. The landed aristocracy,

who faced reduced demand for the agriculture products they produced, attempted to reduce wages for farm
laborers. This led to a number of peasant rebellions in the later half of the fourteenth century.
79. The correct answer is B. Although she was a woman from a peasant family, Joan of Arc (1412–1431)
persuaded Charles the Dauphin, heir to the French throne, to give her a military command against the
English. The French troops, inspired by her religious faith, captured the city of Orleans from the English in
1429 and quickly liberated the entire Loire Valley. In 1430, Joan was captured. She was put on trial and
accused of heresy. Convicted, she was burnt at the stake in 1431.
80. The correct answer is D. During the reign of Edward III (1327–1377), the influence of Parliament
increased. Needing funds to fight France in the Hundred Years' War, Edward agreed not to levy any taxes
without Parliament's consent and to allow Parliament to examine the government's expenditures to ensure that
the tax money was being spent properly. During that era, the House of Lords had more influence than did the
House of Commons.
81. The correct answer is B. Italy was not politically united during the Renaissance. Instead, there were
numerous "states," and some of them, like Florence, were mere city-states. To fight their wars, they hired
mercenaries rather than relying upon their own citizens, most of which were merchants and artisans. The
leaders of the mercenary bands were known as condottieri. Some of the condottieri were Italian but others
came from elsewhere, and a few became military dictators of the states that had originally hired them.
82. The correct answer is B. In the early fourteenth century, the Church and its leaders were forced by the
French monarchy to take up residence at Avignon, an enclave in southern France. In 1377, Pope Gregory XI
returned to Rome. After his death the following year, there was a disputed papal election, with the result that
two "popes" claimed to be the bishop of Rome. One, Urban VI, took up residence in Rome, but the other,
Clement VII, returned to Avignon. The Great Schism of two rival claimants to the papal throne introduced
doctrinal uncertainty into western Christendom.
83. The correct answer is B. Boccaccio's most famous work, The Decameron, is set during the time of the
Black Death. The stories represent society during the plague years from a secular viewpoint. The Prince was
written by Machiavelli; Ignatius Loyola was the author of Spiritual Exercises; Chaucer wrote Canterbury
Tales; and the Divine Comedy was written by Dante.
84. The correct answer is E. "Renaissance" is the French word for rebirth, specifically a renewed interest in
and a rediscovery of the intellectual and artistic accomplishments of ancient Greece and Rome. The dates of
the Italian Renaissance were c. 1300–1550, while the Northern Renaissance occurred somewhat later.
Concepts characteristic of the Renaissance include humanism, secularism, and individualism.
85. The correct answer is E. Giotto (1266–1337) painted with a new kind of realism with the aim of
imitating nature by using three-dimensional depth. Michelangelo, da Vinci, and Raphael are painters of the
High Renaissance of the late fifteenth and sixteenth century, while Donatello was mainly a sculptor, most
famous for his nude statue of the adolescent David.
86. The correct answer is B. Florence was the cultural center of the Renaissance, particularly in the
fifteenth century. Florence was one of Europe's major financial centers and home to bankers such as the
Medici family. Ideals of civic humanism and patriotism inspired many Florentines, resulting in an

environment that produced such notable figures as Dante, Giotto, Masaccio, Ghiberti, Donatello,
Brunelleschi, Botticelli, Michelangelo, and Machiavelli.
87. The correct answer is C. As in ancient Greece and Rome, banquets not only provided the opportunity to
consume good food and enjoy interesting conversation and entertainment, but were an opportunity to impress
others with the power and wealth of one's family. The more ostentatious, showy, and grandiose a banquet,
presumably the higher one's social status. For the wealthy, Renaissance society was based upon conspicuous
consumption.
88. The correct answer is C. Marriages in the Renaissance were more family mergers than the culmination
of love and romance. Marriages were designed to strengthen business, political, or family ties and were
arranged by the family. Young lovers rarely had the opportunity to choose whom they would marry. Women
were generally married between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, while men were usually in their late
twenties or thirties.
89. The correct answer is E. During the fifteenth century, Italy was dominated by five major powers. In the
north was the duchy of Milan and the republic of Venice. The republic of Florence dominated the region of
Tuscany, and the Papal States controlled much of central Italy. The kingdom of Naples ruled most of
southern Italy and the island of Sicily. There were also other smaller states. Political disunity in Italy allowed
more powerful non-Italian nations, such as France and Spain, to periodically invade and ravage the peninsula.
90. The correct answer is C. Machiavelli's The Prince (1513) expressed the modern secular conception of
power politics. A Florentine, Machiavelli had earlier been a member of the state's government. He was also a
student of contemporary Italian politics and had great knowledge of ancient Greece and Rome. In contrast to
late medieval political theorists who claimed that rulers should always act morally and ethically, Machiavelli
argued that princes should do whatever necessary in order to gain and keep power and not be restricted by
moral considerations. The end justifies the means.
91. The correct answer is B. In the fifteenth century, Italian artists experimented with the use of
perspective. The search for naturalism resulted in increased study of the anatomical structure of human
beings, which had become the major subject matter for painters. One of the earliest and most influential
painters to use the laws of perspective was the Florentine painter Masaccio (1421–1428), known for his
frescos in Florence's Brancacci Chapel.
92. The correct answer is D. Michelangelo was already widely famous for his statue of David, which stood
in the city square in Florence, when Pope Julius II requested that Michelangelo decorate the ceiling of the
Sistine Chapel in Rome. Michelangelo reluctantly agreed, and the result was one of the greatest works of art
in the history of western civilization.
93. The correct answer is E. After 1438, the Habsburg dynasty ruled the Holy Roman Empire. Habsburg
success came not on the battlefield but through a series of marriage alliances. Although the Holy Roman
Empire failed to develop a strong centralized monarchy—unlike France, England, and Spain—the Habsburgs
continued to reign as Holy Roman Emperors until the empire was abolished by Napoleon in the early
nineteenth century.
94. The correct answer is D. The Renaissance popes were generally great patrons of Renaissance culture as

exemplified by Pope Julius II (r. 1503–1513), who selected Michelangelo to paint the ceiling in the Sistine
Chapel. However, many of the popes were also debauched and corrupt, such as Alexander VI (1492–1503),
who appointed his son as head of the papal army and made cardinals of another son, a nephew, and the
brother of one of his mistresses.
95. The correct answer is B. Northern humanists, or Christian humanists, deeply immersed themselves in
the study of Greek, not because of their admiration for Plato, Aristotle, and other classical figures, but to be
able to read the Christian Bible in its original written language and to better understand the writings of the
early church fathers. An example is Desiderius Erasmus (1466–1536), who edited the Greek text of the
Christian New Testament and then published it with a new Latin translation in 1516.
96. The correct answer is C. The Catholic Church had traditionally emphasized that personal salvation
depended upon a combination of faith and good works. Luther believed that no one could do a sufficient
number of "good works" to justify or merit salvation. A professor of Christian theology, Luther found his
solution in the Christian Bible: one is justified, or saved, by faith alone.
97. The correct answer is B. The medieval church had established seven sacraments as vehicles of grace,
and partaking of the sacraments was necessary for salvation. Luther rejected the seven sacraments, keeping
only the sacraments of baptism and communion—the Lord's Supper, the equivalent of the Catholic mass.
However, Luther denied that the two he retained had any impact on one's chances of getting into heaven, but
were signs or symbols indicating the promise of salvation.
98. The correct answer is C. Protestants rejected the authority and the doctrines of the Catholic Church, but
there was often little agreement among Protestants. Among the most radical Protestants were the Anabaptists
who advocated a voluntary rather than a state-sponsored church and believed in adult rather than infant
baptism. Some Anabaptists believed in millenarianism, or that the end of the world was imminent and the
kingdom of God would be established.
99. The correct answer is A. When England's Henry VIII (r. 1509–1547) was unable to persuade the
Catholic Church to grant him a divorce from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, his advisors urged him to
turn to Parliament for the solution. Parliament passed legislation stating that there could be no appeals from
an English court to Rome. England's break with the Catholic Church became official in Parliament's Act of
Supremacy of 1534, which stated that the king was the "supreme head on earth of the Church of England."
100. The correct answer is B. John Calvin (1509–1564) generally agreed with Luther's criticisms of the
Catholic Church and Luther's theological beliefs. However, Calvin stressed the omnipotence and
omniscience, or the all-powerful and all-knowing nature, of God. This absolute sovereignty of God logically
led Calvin to the concept of predestination: that God had predestined some to be saved and others to be
damned. One did not have free will to save one's self.
101. The correct answer is C. The Reformation ended or reduced many religious practices associated with
Catholicism, including clerical celibacy, the veneration of relics, the purchases of indulgences, the
elimination of saints, and the numerous religious holy days. However, Protestant reformers were unsuccessful
in their attempts at more secular reforms, such as closing the taverns.
102. The correct answer is D. The Council of Trent (1545–1563) was one of the most significant councils
ANSWER KEY
CLEP Western Civilization I
ANSWER KEY - Page 42
in the history of the Catholic Church. In its final decrees, the council reaffirmed traditional Catholic beliefs
over the beliefs and practices of the Protestant Reformation. The council affirmed the Church's teachings on
the necessity of both faith and good works for salvation, the existence of seven sacraments, and the
excellence of clerical celibacy. The council also initiated a number of reforms to end corruption in the Church
and to establish seminaries for the training of priests.
103. The correct answer is B. Henry of Navarre assumed the French throne in 1589 as Henry IV. Although
he was a Huguenot, or French Protestant, he faced opposition from the Catholic majority. To end the
religious dispute, Henry converted to Catholicism. To reconcile his former coreligionists, in 1598, Henry
issued the Edict of Nantes, which recognized Catholicism to be the official religion of France but also
guaranteed Protestants the right to worship in selected areas, ostensibly recognizing the principle of religious
toleration. Henry's decision was based upon political considerations.
104. The correct answer is D. Sixteenth-century France suffered from a number of civil wars. The causes
varied, and some participants were motivated by political considerations, but the murderous struggle between
the Catholic majority and the Protestant Huguenot minority was at the root of the conflict. The German
painting portrays the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre in all its gore.
105. The correct answer is D. In the late thirteenth century, the Venetian Marco Polo and his father and
uncle journeyed to China, spending a number of years in that country, which was then ruled by Kublai Khan.
After returning to Venice, Polo dictated his memoirs, which became one of the earliest books to be published
by Gutenberg's printing press. Columbus had a copy of Marco Polo's Travels when he began to envision his
voyage across the Atlantic on his way, he believed, to China.
106. The correct answer is E. New ships and new technologies facilitated European attempts to venture out
into the Atlantic. Although the use of the quadrant and knowledge of the Pole Star allowed sailors to calculate
the latitude, the technique was useless south of the equator where the Pole Star was no longer visible. The
compass and the astrolabe, however, compensated for its absence.
107. The correct answer is B. Ferdinand Magellan successfully accomplished the first known
circumnavigation of the earth. Magellan, who embarked in 1519, died in the Philippines in 1521, but one of
his five ships eventually returned to Spain. Columbus led four voyages to the New World beginning in 1492.
In 1498, Vasco da Gama reached India by sailing around Africa. John Cabot, a Venetian, explored the New
England coastline for England. Amerigo Vespucci, a Florentine, made several voyages to the New World,
and his letters describing its geography led to the New World being called "America."
108. The correct answer is B. After the Spanish conquest of much of the New World, native peoples were
made subjects of Queen Isabella and Castile. The encomienda was instituted to allow the Spanish to use the
natives as laborers and to collect tribute from them. Many of the natives were brutally abused as workers in
mines and on plantations, effectively living as slaves.
109. The correct answer is B. Because of its small population, Portugal was unable to successfully colonize
Southeast Asia and monopolize its trade. Although Spain gained control over the Philippines, the major threat
to Portugal's position came from the better financed Dutch and the English. Ultimately, the Dutch evicted the
Portuguese from the Spice Islands and took over their lucrative trade.

110. The correct answer is C. Though the Portuguese were the first Europeans to reach Japan, only the
Dutch were allowed to remain and trade through the port of Nagasaki after disputes, particularly over
religion, led to the expulsion of the Europeans by the mid-sixteenth century. Japan remained "closed" until it
was opened by the American Matthew C. Perry in the 1850s.
111. The correct answer is C. English colonization of North America began in the early seventeenth
century. Migration was fueled by religious, social, and economic motives. The French, also, had a colonial
empire in North America, but Canada was administered autocratically under the French crown exclusively as
a trade entity and thus it never acquired the population of "New" England. By the mid-eighteenth century, the
European population of Canada was estimated at 15,000 in contrast to the 1.5 million in England's thirteen
mainland colonies.
112. The correct answer is D. European exploration and expansion to the New World had considerable
consequences. New foods such as potatoes, corn, tomatoes, and chocolate were imported to Europe, while
horses, cattle, and wheat were exported from Europe to the New World. There was an exchange of diseases
also. It is probable that syphilis was a New World disease that spread throughout Europe in the sixteenth
century, while smallpox, a European disease, devastated the native populations of the western hemisphere.
113. The correct answer is B. Post-conquest Latin America was the first multi-racial society. Many of the
Spanish and Portuguese who immigrated to the New World were males, who consequently married female
natives. The offspring of Europeans and Native Americans became known as Mestizos. Africans were
imported to the Western hemisphere as slaves, and the offspring of Europeans and Africans were known as
mulattoes. In contrast to Latin America, British North America had a more balanced population of European
men and women.
114. The correct answer is A. Catholic Christian missionaries, particularly Jesuits, were active in China in
the seventeenth century. However, the arrival of the Dominicans and the Franciscans led to rivalries between
the several Catholic religious orders. In gaining Chinese converts to Christianity, the Jesuits had allowed
converts to continue to venerate their ancestors. The pope condemned ancestor worship and the result was
that Chinese authorities suppressed Christianity.
115. The correct answer is B. Although religious disputes between Catholics and Protestants played a part
in the witchcraft craze of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, recent historical interpretations have
focused upon the decline of traditional communal values due in part to the increasing economic individualism
of the era. The poor, particularly old women, became obvious scapegoats of those communal fears.
116. The correct answer is B. Cardinal Richelieu was the chief minister to Louis XIII between 1624 and
1642. His policies, largely successful, led to the strengthening of the central role of the French monarchy in
both domestic and foreign areas. He used spies against overly ambitious nobles; he eliminated the private
armies of the aristocracy and tore down the walls of cities under Huguenot control. One problem he was
unable to solve, however, was the plight of the government's economic woes, and the French debt continued
to rise during his tenure.
117. The correct answer is C. The Treaty of Westphalia of 1648 ended the disastrously destructive Thirty
Years' War. The treaty stated that each of the German states was allowed to determine its own religion:
Catholicism, Lutheranism, or Calvinism. The Holy Roman Empire was weakened, and the more than 300

states that made up the empire became virtually independent. However, the Habsburgs continued to rule as
emperors.
118. The correct answer is D. The major reason for Parliament's success over Charles I and his Royalist
supporters was the effectiveness of Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army. Many of Cromwell's soldiers were
radical Puritans who believed that they were fighting for God. Although Parliament's weaponry was no
different than that of the Royalists, Cromwell trained his disciplined army in the latest military tactics.
England's Protestant Parliament received no aid from the Catholic French.
119. The correct answer is B. William Shakespeare (1564–1616) best captures the patriotic enthusiasm and
pride of the English during the Elizabethan era, perhaps most famously in his play Richard II and the excerpt
"This royal throne, this sceptered isle,/This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,/This other Eden, demiParadise/....This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England."
120. The correct answer is D. The secularism, confidence, and balance of the High Renaissance painters
such as Raphael and da Vinci gave way, under the religious impulses of the Reformations, to the school of
Mannerism, of which El Greco (1541–1614) is the most notable figure. In El Greco's works, the artist strives
to portray intense emotion as here in his painting of The Laocoon.
